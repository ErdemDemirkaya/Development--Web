    "In the previous lesson you learned how to map data structures into tables in a database through the EF (our chosen ORM). In this document you will learn how to access and interact with the data stored in the database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This document guides you through the main constructs of the Language Integrate Query (LINQ). LINQ is a a component of the .Net Framework that allows .Net languages to interact with objects (in our case the data stored in the database which are presented as objects by the EF) by means of a declarative syntax similar to Structured Query Language (SQL). As in SQL, LINQ operators in general can project, filter, etc. data from matrices , enumerable classes, XML, etc. As result of a query in LINQ, we have always a collection of objects that can be enumerated. Every query in LINQ is type-checked. This means that queries which envolve objects that are not compatible with each other will not be executed. When connected to a database LINQ queries are translated to their SQL respective at compile time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the EF reduces the complexity, performing queries in an application needs to be done carefully to avoid side-effects, such as opening and closing too often the connection with the DB, selecting more than necessary, queries that produce bad access plans, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous practicum we started to model a movie database, first with a 1<>Many relation and then with a Many<>Many relation. To avoid too much complexity and focus only on the topic of this lesson (LINQ), in the model of this practicum a `Movie` entity has a one-to-many relationship with an `Actor` entity. In the following we will see how to use LINQ to interact with our data. In the end we will see how to analyse the compiled queries to, for example, assess the performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note. For every LINQ query we will first mention its equivalent version in pseudo-SQL.\n",
