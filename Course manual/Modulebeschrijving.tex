	\textbf{Learning objectives:} &
		The course has the following learning goals: 
			\begin{itemize}
					\item (U\_M) students understand the model of a given MVC application in order to interact with a permanent storage structure; 
					\item (U\_C) students understand a given controller of an MVC application in order to handle interactions with
the model; 
					\item (U\_V) students understand the view of a given MVC application in order to add interaction elements and improve safeness.
					\item (PR\_M) students can work with the model of a given MVC application in order to interact with a permanent storage structure; 
					\item  (PR\_C) students can work with a given controller of an MVC application in order to handle interactions with
the model; 
					\item (PR\_V) students can work with the view of a given MVC application in order to add interaction elements and improve safeness.
\end{itemize}

The course, and therefore also the learning goals, are limited to
idiomatic C\# and .Net Core constructs, and idiomatic TypeScript and
React constructs (augmented with a few essential \emph{npm} libraries
such as Immutablejs and Fetch).\\
