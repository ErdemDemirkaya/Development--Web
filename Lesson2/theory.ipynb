    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "- how do we access the data from other machines?\n",
    "    - logical access: not all queries make sense, and we only want to present a reasonable interface\n",
    "        - `Course 1 - N CourseLecture N - 1 Lecture` in the DB might be published as `Course 1 - N Lecture`\n",
    "        - Unpublished/draft lectures might be filtered (and thus not given as result)\n",
    "    - security: not all data might be seen by everyone; we only want to allow users to see/write data they are allowed to see/write:\n",
    "        - suppose students are grouped in classes: `Class 1 - N Student`\n",
    "        - courses are bound to classes: `Course 1 - N Class`\n",
    "        - a course also has exams: `Course 1 - N Exam`\n",
    "        - suppose a student asks for all available exams: which exams should he get?\n",
    "            - _all exams of all courses bound to the class of the student_\n",
    "            - otherwise students get to see illegally available information, and you do not want to be the programmer to explain this to your manager :)\n",
    "- this means that we need a way to perform `queries` when retrieving data from our ORM\n",
    "- the ORM so far was just a series of data types\n",
    "- the ORM also presents an interface to access the tables, in EF called `database context`\n",
    "    - each table gets a property which has the same name as the table, and as type a generic container (`DbSet<T>`) with the class mapping the table type `public DbSet<Teacher> Teacher { get; set; }`\n",
    "- there is an issue though: suppose we want to perform a query on a huge table, with gigabytes of data: how will this happen?\n",
    "    - should we copy all the table data in memory, and then query it with `while`/`foreach` loops?\n",
    "    - do we expect to discard most of the data?\n",
    "    - is this feasible for performance? What if the database is stored on another machine?\n",
    "- we want to be able to run queries *as if* we were running them locally, but instead accumulating the instructions to later execute, in one go, in the database; this way, we only request the result once, when it is actually used:\n",
    "    - build a `IQueryable<T>` object, which will contain the data needed to generate an SQL query which will yield a series of `T`'s\n",
    "        - use and combine other queries to get to the desired `IQueryable<T>`\n",
    "    - send our query to the database and get the results\n",
    "        - this is done by invoking `ToList` on the `IQueryable<T>`, leading to a `List<T>`\n",
    "    - the `IQueryable<T>` contains no data, and is \"owned\" by the database\n",
    "    - the `List<T>` contains the data, and is \"owned\" by the application\n",
    "- how do we bootstrap a query?\n",
    "    - the type `DbSet<T>` encapsulates a table access, and is also an `IQueryable<T>`, so this will usually be our starting point for a query\n",
    "- how do we transform queries?\n",
    "    - we can map them (queries are functors): `Select: IQueryable<T>, Func<T,U> => IQueryable<U>`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Students.Select(s => s.Name)` is an `IQueryable<string>`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Students.Select(s => s.Name).Select(n => n.Length)` is an `IQueryable<int>`\n",
    "        - ...\n",
    "    - we can filter them (queries are functors): `Where: IQueryable<T>, Func<T,bool> => IQueryable<T>`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Students.Where(s => s.Name != \"Jim\")` is an `IQueryable<Student>`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Course.Where(s => s.StudyPoints > 2)` is an `IQueryable<Course>`\n",
    "        - ...\n",
    "    - we can also perform data aggregation: `Any: IQueryable<T>, Func<T,bool> => bool`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Students.Any(s => s.Name == \"Pim\")`\n",
    "        - example: `dbContext.Courses.Any(c => c.StartDate >= DateTime.Now && c.EndDate <= DateTime.Now)`\n",
    "        - ...\n",
    "    - there are various other aggregation functions: \n",
    "        - `Count: IQueryable<T> => int`\n",
    "        - `Count: IQueryable<T>, Func<T,bool> => int`\n",
    "        - `Aggregate: IQueryable<T>, U, Func<U,T,U> => IQueryable<U>`\n",
    "            - example: `dbContext.Students.Aggregate(\"\", (names,s) => names + \" \" + s)`\n",
    "            - ...\n",
    "            - Note that aggregate is actually sufficient to implement all other aggregation operators\n",
    "                - show how to build `Count` and `Any` from `Aggregate`\n",
    "        - And many more operators, use GIYF (\"Google Is Your Friend\") for them\n",
    "    - there also exists a fundamental mechanism to **bind** queries together; suppose you had:\n",
    "        - an `IQueryable<T>`, which will yield a series of values of type `T`\n",
    "        - a transformation function `Func<T, IQueryable<U>>`, which for each element of type `T` produces a series of `U`'s\n",
    "        - then we can obtain an `IQueryable<U>`, which is a series of `U`'s, by concatenating all transformations of the original query\n",
    "        - this is called `SelectMany`\n",
    "        - examples of `SelectMany`        \n",
    "- LINQ also comes equipped with a special sql-like syntax for creating \"simple\" queries\n",
    "- this syntax makes it easier to write queries without having to work with higher order functions and such\n",
    "- it yields very readable code, especially when joining or performing sub-queries\n",
    "- the starting point is one or more `from V in Q`, each of which gives name `V` to all elements of `Q` (`Q : IQueryable<T>`)\n",
    "- then we can apply a series of predicates by `where P`, where `P` is a boolean expression that depends on the `V`'s\n",
    "- we can even perform sub-queries or declare new variables by using `let V = E`, where `E` is an arbitrary expression (even a full blown query!) and `V` is a fresh variable name\n",
    "- when we are done, we can yield a result by `select E`, where `E` is an arbitrary expression\n",
    "- so `dbContext.Student.Where(s => s.Age > 20).Select(s => s.Name)` would become the arguably more readable:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from s in dbContext.Student\n",
    "where s.Age > 20\n",
    "select s.Name\n",
    "```\n",
    "- we can also perform sub queries such as\n",
    "```\n",
    "from c in dbContext.Class\n",
    "let students = from s in dbContext.Student\n",
    "               where s.ClassId == c.Id\n",
    "               select s\n",
    "select Tuple.Create(c, students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- show how the queries above are translated with `SelectMany`\n",
    "- show some more examples of queries, for example all lectures from all courses that a given student `s` may see\n",

    "We can also point out that LINQ is a much more general tool than just a way to write LINQ queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- let us build a generic container, `M<T>` (for example `Option<T>`)\n",
    "- let us add two static extension methods:\n",
    "    - `ToM : T => M<T>`\n",
    "    - `SelectMany : M<T>, Func<T, M<U>>, Func<T, U, V> => M<V>`\n",

    "- as long as `M` offers an implementation for such methods, then we say that `M` is a _monad_ and LINQ will support it with syntactic sugar\n",
    "    - examples of monads range from multithreading, to reactive programming, to coroutines, and much much more\n",
    "    - monads are one of the most powerful and flexible tools to perform meta-programming, and are an incredibly flexible design pattern"
