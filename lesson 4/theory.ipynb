    "_Note_: ensure that students copy, by hand and on paper, the various definitions written by the teacher on the whiteboard. It is strongly advised to ask students *not* to use a laptop, as it will prove distracting.\n",

    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss the fact that we now want some requests to return pages instead of just JSON data\n",
    "- The REST API remains intact, but we also return pages to match the REST API with something human-readable\n",
    "- This means that the server-side application will need to generate HTML from the requested data\n",
    "- Generating HTML will require embedding some dynamic elements (depending on the data) with some static elements (depending on the page)\n",
    "    - For example, consider a page which says: `The current time is HH:MM`, where `HH:MM` is the current time\n",
    "    - The string `The current time is ` is static, meaning that it does not matter when and how we visit the page: it will always be the same\n",
    "    - `HH:MM`, on the other hand, is dynamic: it needs to be recomputed whenever the user visits the page\n",
    "- The core mechanism to achieve this is the Razor template, which outputs HTML starting from a _template_ containing C# and HTML mixed together\n",
    "    - HTML for the static part\n",
    "    - C# for the dynamic part\n",
    "- The dynamic part will be anything that can change over time, thus mostly data from the database\n",
    "    - The queries that provide the data for the Razor view are the same that provide the data for the REST api\n",
    "        - (So it is a good idea to refactor them to a neutral, utilities class or similar)\n",
    "- Basic Razor is just HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p>Hello World</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `@` character is used to denote C# code inside the Razor template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p>@DateTime.Now</p>\n",
    "<p>@DateTime.IsLeapYear(2016)</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can transition from HTML to C# with `@{ ... }`\n",
    "    - For example, to declare variables\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@{\n",
    "    var joe = new Person(\"Joe\", 33);\n",
    " }\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Age @(joe.Age)</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside a C# block we can implicitly go back to HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@{\n",
    "    var inCSharp = true;\n",
    "    <p>Now in HTML, was in C# @inCSharp</p>\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This allows us to use conditional or looping statements to generate dynamically sized content such as lists of items\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@for (var i = 0; i < people.Length; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    var person = people[i];\n",
    "    <text>Name: @person.Name</text>\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@if (value % 2 == 0)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    <p>The value is even</p>\n",
    "}\n",
    "else if (value >= 1337)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    <p>The value is large.</p>\n",
    "}\n",
    "else\n",
    "{\n",

    "- In order to invoke a Razor template from a controller method, we must have a file with a specific location and name: `Views/ControllerName/MethodName.cshtml`\n",
    "    - When then controller method returns `View()`, then the corresponding Razor template is instantiated\n",
    "\n",
    "- The common parts of page layout are usually stored in a separate Razor template, by default `_Layout.cshtml`\n",
    "    - This way, the individual Razor pages will be able to focus on their specifics, and not on (repeated) generic boilerplate\n",

    "- Notice that `@RenderBody()` specifies where to place the output of the Razor templates using this template\n",
