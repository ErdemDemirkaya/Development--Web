    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss the fact that we now want to be able to allow access to our data from other locations, which is the overall goal of a distributed application\n",
    "- In order to be able to access data, we create an HTTP API (short API from now on)\n",
    "- An API is a series of methods that can be implicitly called when some URL's are visited\n",
    "    - A URL request also contains a request body\n",
    "    - Method parameters are passed as elements of the URL, or inside the body\n",
    "    - A URL request also contains a tag (_HTTP method_)\n",
    "        - `GET` \n",
    "        - `POST`\n",
    "        - `PUT`\n",
    "        - `DELETE`\n",
    "    - A router, or routing rules, define which method is called by which URL, and what parts of the URL (if any) are parsed as parameters of the method\n",
    "- All the API (methods) related to a single entity (for example `Student`) are usually put in a single class (in our example below, StudentApiController), but YMMV (_your mileage may vary_)\n",
    "- What methods do we add?\n",
    "    - A very common approach to structure data access is called REST\n",
    "        - REST means _representational state transfer_\n",
    "    - REST assumes that all calls related to an entity are found based on a single URL, such as `xxx.com/students`\n",
    "    - the most common methods are\n",
    "        - `GET` on `xxx.com/students` will give us back all students\n",
    "        - `GET` on `xxx.com/students/{id}` will give us back the student with `id = {id}`\n",
    "        - `POST` on `xxx.com/students` will create a new student (usually the student to add is in the body of the request)\n",
    "        - `PUT` on `xxx.com/students/{id}` will change student with `id = {id}` to the value sent through the body\n",
    "        - `DELETE` on `xxx.com/students/{id}` will remove the student with `id = {id}`\n",
    "    - methods do not always succeed right away, so some methods need to exhibit some additional properties if the network layer sends them multiple times in a row\n",
    "    - `GET` must be nullipotent: it must not change the database\n",
    "    - `PUT/POST/DELETE` must be idempotent: the same call, multiple times in a row must produce the same result\n",
    "- Example of such a class in C#:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Route(\"api/students\")]\n",
    "public class StudentApiController : Controller\n",

    "- The class above implements a RESTful interface on `xxx/students`. In general, in .NET an application is RESTful if:\n",
    "    - there is a class implementing the router attribute (`[Route(\"...\")]`)\n",
    "    - there is a series of methods implementing get, post, put and delete operations\n",
    "    - `startup.cs` contains `app.UseMvc(routes => {});` (null configuration), necessary to register the router to the services exposed by the server\n",
    "- An API call automatically transfers data via JSON, which is serialized and deserialized automatically (structural errors prevent completion of the call for type safety and security reasons)\n",
    "- The body of the methods is just a combination of LINQ and regular code\n",
    "    - `Ok` denotes that we give a result back (the argument is the result, seralized to JSON)\n",
    "    - There are various methods such as `Ok` that we can give to signal errors, such as _not found_, _unauthorized_, and much more\n",
    "- Suppose now that we have a lot of students (hundreds of thousands)\n",
    "    - `GetAll` is a bit of an issue\n",
    "    - A malicious attacker could cause a DDOS (distributed denial of service) by simply spinning up a lot of requests\n",
    "    - Requests would all eventually fail because of timeout\n",
    "    - Our server would be quickly overwhelmed\n",
    "- The solution is pagination: we return a block of data (called _a page_), never bigger than a given amount of elements\n",

    "```\n",
    "[HttpGet]\n",
    "public IActionResult GetAll([FromQuery] int page_index, [FromQuery] int page_size)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GetAll` will now return the elements from `page_index * page_size` to `page_index * page_size + page_size - 1`\n",
    "- We can impose a maximum cap for `page_size`, so that if the user asks for more than, say, 100 students, we still only give 100 back\n",
    "- `GetAll` will therefore return a JSON result looking like\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    page_index: ...\n",
    "    page_size: ...\n",
    "    num_pages: ...\n",
    "    students: [ ... ]    \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- notice that the parameters `page_index` and `page_size` come from the query part of the URL itself\n",
    "    - For example: `xxx/students?page_index=10&page_size=25`\n",
    "    - Everything after the `?` is the query\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GetAll` now contains basic filtering (basic because it is simply a range)\n",
    "- it is possible to add more parameters to perform extra filtering\n",
    "- a typical strategy is also to define a parameterized, hierarchical data structure which specifies a filter\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expr = And(Expr, Expr) | Or(Expr,Expr) | GreaterThan(Property,Const) | ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- the `GetAll` method can then parse and transform this data structure into a `Where` clause dynamically\n",
    "    - LINQ also offers `Expr`, which is an interface to automatically build predicates and other expressions dynamically\n",
    "- `GetAll` can also receive as optional parameters one or more properties to sort by (`OrderBy`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSON is not efficient compared to binary, but it is helpful for humans\n",
    "    - Compare the size of `{ Name:\"Johnatan\", Surname:\"Ridderkerk\", BirthDate:02/03/1996 }` in JSON (count the characters: $63$ bytes, even more in UTF16) to the binary size: $\\mathbb{S}(8) \\times \\mathbb{S}(10) \\times \\mathbb{I} \\times \\mathbb{I} \\times \\mathbb{I} = 9 + 11 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32$ bytes\n",
    "    - Be careful, because the binary serializer can make a huge performance difference"
