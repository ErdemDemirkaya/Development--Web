    "The goal of this practicum is to implement a web application programming interface (web API) that is RESTful. The Web API will use the `model`, `controller` and `action` concepts from the MVC pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous practicums you were able to implement the `model` part and design queries that store and retrieve data from the database. In this practicum you will perform three activities. In the first activity you will implement the controller that will be mapped directly to a resources `uri` (/api/movies). Actions are used to map to specific `HTTP` verbs, such as `GET` and `POST`, to perform a specific operation (`GetAll` Movies) and to provide a response to a client. In the second activity we will add pagination functionality to our implementation. In the third activity we will add dynamic filtering using `LINQ Expressions` to our implementation.   \n",
    "The activities performed are:\n",
    "- 1 - Build a single RESTful controller against an EF database\n",
    "- 2 - Add pagination to `GetAll`\n",
    "- 3 - Add generic predicate filtering to `GetAll`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Building a RESTful controller and testing it with POSTMAN\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Setup project\n",
    "- To start the implementation you need two addtional tools: \n",
    "    - A HTTP client named `Postman` that sends and receives HTTP messages (json) to and from a web API. Download Postman from https://www.getpostman.com/ \n",
    "\n",
    "    - A .net core package called `Newtonsoft.Json` to serialize json messages and deserialize them into .NET objects. This package will be added after project creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to automatically generate a controller in dotnet core we will create a `webapi-application`.  Then we add the `model` part to it (see step 3). To set up a webapi-project in a folder called lesson3 execute the following command: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet new webapi -o lesson3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Navigate to the folder of your project and type the following commands in the command line:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json\n",
    "dotnet restore\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can compile and run this project to check if the web API is working. After executing the run-command `dotnet run` in the console, your web API will start working by showing the message: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Now listening on: http://localhost:5000`\n",
    "`Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Step 2: Web API check\n",
    "\n",

    "Pagination comes useful when dealing with big amounts of data. Since it is too _expensive_ to move big amounts of data between client and server, we use pagination as a mean to load the data resulting from a query, but, instead of loading it all at once, we load it in pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following schema a user is asking for the page at position 3 of size 3. The controller will use the given page size info to split the data into pages, each containing at most 3 items, and returning the page in position 3 (in our case the fourth one).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"20.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the page's items, the controller returns also the total number of pages; this is necessary in case the client needs to know how many pages are left to visit all the items.\n",

    "- The implementation of the pagination can be added in a separate folder \n",
    "    - Create a folder called `Utility` inside your project directory \n",
    "    - Create a class called `Pagination.cs`  inside that folder\n",
    "    - Define a namespace for your implementation (for example `Paginator`)\n",
    "    - Add the `Page` class inside that file with the follwoing three properties\n",

    "We extend the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbSet` data structure with an additional generic method `GetPage<T>`. This method allows us to select a page and the number of recrods retruned for each page. The keyword `this` refers to the `DbSet` data structure that will make the call. \n",

    "### 3 Adding generic predicate filtering\n",
    "To use generic predicates to select entities of our database you need to use LINQ dynamically by means of `Expression Trees` [1].

    "In the following picture we present a schematized version of a simple application. In the schema a client is trying to get all the actors from a remote database who are called `Pippo` and whose age is 18. To do so, the client first builds a filter expression (**1**) that captures the just mentioned conditions, and then calls (**2**) the remote method `GetAll` to which we pass the filter expression (_our predicate_) as a json string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "The controller captures the call request (**3**) and forwards it to the right method (**4**). The method `GetAll` converts the input filter expression to an equivalent version in `Expression Tree`. The converted expression and the rest of the query is then passed to EF (**5**) which takes care of selecting the right actors. Once selected, the actors are returned back to the client (**6**). The client, which in the meantime was waiting for a response (**2.1**), receives the actors and saves them (**7**).\n",
